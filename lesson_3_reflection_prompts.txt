When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  Remote repository is used when I am using multiple systems, and in gitHub.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	Because I dont want my local repository updated with the changes and features that I dont need.
