When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  Remote repository is used when I am using multiple systems, and in gitHub.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	Because I dont want my local repository updated with the changes and features that I dont need.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
	Forks are a clone of repository withing github. Clones is a process of copying a remote repository content to local repository. Branch is creating a different set of feature under a different lable or branch.
